## API Integration

The application integrates with the Marvel API for fetching character and comic data. The `api.ts` file in `infrastructure` manages API requests and includes data mappers for processing API responses.

## Design Implementation

The application's design is based on Figma designs provided for mobile and desktop views. Components are styled using CSS modules for scoped styling.

## Development Setup

Setting up the development environment is very straightforward

-   **Environment variables**: Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and provide the variables with the appropiate values according to the [Marvel API guidelines](https://developer.marvel.com/documentation/getting_started)
-   **Dependencies**: Ensure Node.js and dependencies from `package.json` are installed (`npm install`).
-   **Start Development**: Run `npm start` to launch the application in development mode using webpack dev server.
-   **Build**: Generate a production build with `npm run build`.

## Testing

Testing is implemented using Jest and React Testing Library (`npm test`). Unit tests are located in respective `__tests__` directories under `pages` and inside each `component`. The project maintains a test coverage of over 90%, ensuring comprehensive testing of components and application logic.

## Accessibility

The application ensures accessibility by using semantic HTML, alt attributes for images, and adhering to accessibility guidelines for interactive elements.

## Linting and Code Quality

Linting is managed with ESLint and Prettier to maintain code quality (`npm run lint`). Configuration files (`.eslintrc`, `.prettierrc`) are included in the project root. TypeScript support is integrated to enhance type safety and development efficiency.

## Usage

1. **Homepage**: Displays a list of Marvel characters with search functionality.
2. **Character Detail Page**: Shows detailed information about a selected character, including comics they appear in and ordered by year of release.
3. **Favorites**: Allows users to mark characters as favorites, persisting across sessions using Context API.

## Stack

-   React (v18.3+)
-   Node.js (v18+)
-   TypeScript
-   CSS
-   Context API for state management

## Hexagonal Architecture Implementation

This project follows the principles of Hexagonal Architecture, also known as Ports and Adapters Architecture. This architectural style promotes a clean separation of concerns, making the system more maintainable, testable, and extensible. Here's a brief overview of how it's implemented:

-   **Domain Layer (`/domain`)**

    -   This layer contains the core business logic and domain entities such as `character.ts`, `comic.ts`, and `favorites.ts`.
    -   It is the heart of the application, encapsulating all the business rules and remaining independent of external systems and frameworks.

-   **Application Layer (`/application`)**

    -   This layer includes application-specific logic, such as context providers (`/context`) and custom hooks (`/hooks`).
    -   It acts as a mediator between the domain layer and the outer layers (infrastructure and presentation), coordinating the applicationâ€™s workflow and state management.

-   **Infrastructure Layer (`/infrastructure`)**

    -   This layer manages external systems, APIs, data mappers, and utility functions.
    -   It includes:
        -   **API communication (`/api`)**: Handles API calls and constants.
        -   **Data Mappers (`/mappers`)**: Transforms data between different layers, ensuring that the domain remains isolated from external data formats.
        -   **Utilities (`/utils`)**: Provides helper functions to support the infrastructure needs.

-   **Presentation Layer (`/presentation`)**

    -   This layer is responsible for the user interface and user interactions, consisting of components, pages, layouts, assets, and global styles.
    -   It includes:
        -   **Components (`/components`)**: Reusable UI components like `CharacterCard`, `Header`, and `SearchBar`.
        -   **Pages (`/pages`)**: Main application views such as `Characters`, `Favorites`, and `CharacterDetail`.
        -   **Layouts (`/layouts`)**: Layout components that structure the page.
        -   **Assets (`/assets`)**: Static assets like SVG icons.
        -   **Global Styles (`/globals`)**: Application-wide styles.

-   **Main Entry Point**
    -   Files like `App.tsx` and `main.tsx` initialize and render the application, connecting the presentation layer with the application logic.
-   **Testing**
    -   Test files (`*.test.tsx`) are properly organized within their respective contexts to ensure thorough and maintainable testing practices.

### Architecture Features

-   **Modularity**: Each layer is independent and can be tested in isolation.
-   **Dependency Inversion**: High-level components (`pages`) depend on abstractions (`hooks`, `context`) rather than concrete implementations.
-   **Testability**: Easy to mock dependencies for unit testing, especially in the application and domain layers.
-   **Maintainability**: Changes in external APIs or UI components can be accommodated without affecting core business logic.
